In the end I found it too cutesy so I switched back.
- function
- generator
- graphical

- semantics: The meaning of something. Typically an equation will have two aspects: how it's written

- syntax: How something is written. Typically an equation will have two aspects: how it's written
(e.g. with symbols or a drawing) and what it means (what relationship it imposes on its variables).
The purpose of this website is to explore a new syntax for simple equations.
We're not doing anything new on the meaning side of things.
