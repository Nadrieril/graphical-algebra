# Graphical Algebra

Welcome!
This is a collaborative resource to explain, explore and play with Graphical Algebra.

Graphical Algebra is a new way of writing maths that uses 2d drawings instead of symbols.
This website contains articles, videos and links that
explain how it works and explore what we can do with it.

You can get started here: TODO


## Goals/Values

- **Fun**: We're here because we find Graphical Algebra exciting. We want to share that!
Expect excitement and rants and hand-waving.
- **Rich**: We want a lush and dense resource that one can wade through with delight,
following their curiosity.
- **Best effort**: Better to have something than nothing.
We can always improve later; put the thing out there before it's perfect.

<!-- - **Emergence**: Structure will emerge as we iterate on what we have. Let it surprise us! -->
<!-- - **Feedback**: Want dynamic and feedback and iteration -->
<!-- - **Exploration**: The core idea of GA can be explained in 3 minutes. Everything else is commentary on it. So let's explore it to death. -->
<!-- - **Many-facets**: Everyone has different background knowledge and sees things differently. -->
<!-- Let's gather as many different angles as we can, so that everyone can find what they need. -->


## Contributing

Hey you! If you found this cool come chat!
I want to make this collaborative but it's just me for now.
I'd love to know what you liked and what you want to see more of.

For now all the content is by me (Guillaume Boisseau).
I personally find videos the easiest to produce, so that's why there's mostly videos on here.
I welcome all forms of media though!
For example textual articles are probably a lot better as a resource you want to look at often.

There are endless ways to contribute:
- Ask an obvious/stupid question.
If you can't find the answer, that means the website can do better!
- Ask a deeper question about what's going on there
- Ask a tangential question because this reminds you of something
- Notice that some article should mention some other relevant article
- Solve an equation, and let us know how it went
- Try to do something and fail (and let us know what happened)
- Explain something in your own words
- Take a know theorem and reprove it graphically (and let us know how it went)
- Find an example of something that's hard/impossible to do in GA
- Suggest a topic for a video I could record.
I love to explain things, just let me know where to start
- etc.

For now the only way to contribute is via [the GitHub repo for this website](https://github.com/Nadrieril/graphical-algebra)
(or, \*shudders\* YouTube comments),
which is really not convenient.
I'll make a twitter and a discord soonish.
