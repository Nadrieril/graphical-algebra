# Graphical Algebra

I want to make a collaborative resource to help explain, discover and expand on Graphical Algebra.

## Current Plan

- Gather all the existing resources I can find on the topic: blog posts, academic papers, videos,
twitter threads.
- Enable collaboration. I want it to be super easy for people to ask questions, and
relatively accessible for them to make contributions.
- Add content myself. Probably short videos answering the questions. In my current vision, I want an
interlinked website where each video has a bunch of questions answered underneath with links to
other parts of the website.

I expect to do a lot of the content creation at the beginning, and move to curation once I get more
people excited.


## Non-goals

- I don't aim for exhaustivity. I would rather have a clear resource.
- I don't want to be formal. RIgor is important but I'll aim for intuition and accessibility first.
- I don't have a clear audience in mind. I expect some things will be accessible to kids in school
and others to people with experience in linear algebra. I might want to indicate the audience for
each page someday actually.
- I must refrain from planning the structure of the website, or I'll never do anything.

## Contributing

The simplest way to contribute is to ask a question!
I'm happy to answer them and they'll make the website grow.
I haven't yet decided what's the best way.
YouTube comments work for now, I intend to set up a twitter account at some point.

Another way to contribute is via GitHub.
Come file an issue or propose a PR!
