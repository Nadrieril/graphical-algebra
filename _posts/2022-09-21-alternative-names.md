# Alternative Names for GA

I've had a few ideas for other names to call "Graphical Algebra",
and as of today I still can't quite decide:

- Graphical Algebra

  Based on "Graphical Linear Algebra" which is the name used in academic papers.
  This is in some sense the correct name; it describes what we're doing.

  This is the one my academic side likes most.
  I'm afraid it's too scary-sounding for newcomers.

- Equation Lego

  Emphasizes composition as a core idea.
  Defines a clear playground in which people can run wild with new ideas.

  This is the one my teacher side likes most.
  I'm afraid it's too cutesy.

- The Dance of Plus and Equals

  Emphasizes the utter conceptual simplicity of looking at the interactions between plus and equals
  and running with that.
  I'm also a fan of the visual metaphor: equational reasoning does look like movement.

  This is the one my poetic side likes most.

- Alien Math

  Emphasizes the language aspect.
  What if aliens had a very different-looking math? Maybe it'd look like GA.
  What would it feel like to be using that?

  I don't know which side prefers that one.

Any other ideas?
