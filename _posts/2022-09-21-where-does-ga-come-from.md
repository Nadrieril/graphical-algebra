# Where does GA come from?

Using drawing for illustrative purposes has no age.
Using drawing as proper mathematical syntax,
i.e. something unambiguous that counts as valid proof,
has probably been tried several times.
I only know of one other case: C.S. Peirce's [Existential Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph)
(his [beta system](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce-logic/#BetaSyst) is literally a generalization of GA).

The real start of GA was the 2014 paper
{% post_link _posts/2022-09-15-interacting-hopf-algebras.md %}
that proves that we can 1/ denote linear relations graphically,
and 2/ prove when two are equivalent using a set of graphical axioms.

<!-- The notation used came from TODO -->

I don't know who coined the name "Graphical Linear Algebra",
but I believe Pawel Sobocinski popularized it with his blog
{% post_link _posts/2022-09-15-graphicallinearalgebra-net.md %}.

GLA was then extended to cover more and more general relations,
and the authors kept the naming scheme:

- {% post_link _posts/2022-09-15-graphical-affine-algebra.md %}
- Diagrammatic Polyhedral Algebra
- Graphical Piecewise-Linear Algebra

I _think_ I was the first to point out there was a field there and call it "Graphical Algebra",
but it's not like that name was hard to come up with.
