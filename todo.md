# Ideas for the future

## Structure of the website

- Add some 3-sec intro to GA on the main page
- Add a main image to each post, that captures what the post is about
- Some kind of tagging to identify required background knowledge
- Some kind of tagging to identify ranty, best-effort articles vs well-done ones


## Better collaboration

- Make a discord?
- Make a twitter account and post videos there?
- Integrate twitter replies as comments on articles somehow?
- Write a guide for those who want to contribute to the website on github directly

A big question I have is: how to make the website feel more dynamic?
For now it feels "Set in stone, written down by a Source Of Knowledge".
I'd rather have a feeling of "Here's our collaborative notes from our journeys into this new world.
Join us!".

- At the end of each post, add some easy options for contribution like:
"suggest a related article" or "ask a question" or "I don't see how this link is related"


## Specific articles/videos

- Explain the 2d syntax in contrast to the 1d syntax. Don't even need to mention semantics much
